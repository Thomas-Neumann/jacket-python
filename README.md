# jacket-python

My personal Python template for writing new utilities. Write once, use many.

The code in this repo is in early development and primarily for my own use.
I know how to use it and that's good enough for now. Will be polished over
time with every new project created.


_jacket - don't leave home without it_

# Purpose

This cookiecutter template provides a basic setup for developing a new
utility.

It is specifically designed to make it easy to switch from a command line
interface to an AWS Lambda function or a REST API since this is a commonly
seen trajectory for maturing code.

# Quickstart

## Requirements

This template uses the cookiecutter module. Please ensure it is installed
locally.

Using pip with the OS-provided Python:

`pip install --user cookiecutter`

Using venv with a custom Python runtime:

_... add documentation ..._

## Initialize a new project
